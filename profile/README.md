## Why Gno? 

- A better programming language for smart contracts: Gno.land utilizes the Gno programming language, which is an interpreted variation of Go. It is executed through a specialized virtual machine called the GnoVM, purpose-built for the Gno.land blockchain. There are some differences among the languages: Gno does not support Goroutines, channels and non-deterministic libraries like `crypto/rand`, and it supports additional features like automatic persistence of global variables for storing state.

- Consensus Protocol - Tendermint2: Gno.land achieves consensus between blockchain nodes using the Tendermint2 consensus protocol. This approach ensures secure and reliable network operation.

- Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC): In the future, Gno.land will be able to communicate and exchange data with other blockchain networks within the Cosmos ecosystem through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

## Why Go-Based?
The decision to base Gno.land's language on Go was influenced by the following factors:

- Standard and Secure Language: Go is a well-established and secure programming language, widely adopted in the software development community. By leveraging Go's features, Gno.land benefits from a robust and proven foundation.

- User-Friendly: Go's simplicity and ease of understanding make it beginner-friendly. This accessibility lowers the entry barrier for developers to create Smart Contracts on the Gno.land platform.

**Coming from other blockchains like Ethereum?**

Gno.land offers a few distinct advantages to Ethereum:

1. Transparent and Auditable Smart Contracts: Gno.land Smart Contracts are fully transparent and auditable by users because the actual source code is uploaded to the blockchain. In contrast, Ethereum uses Solidity, which requires precompilation into bytecode, leading to less transparency as bytecode is stored on the blockchain, not the human-readable source code.

2. General-Purpose Language: Gno.land's Gnolang is a general-purpose language, similar to Go, extending its usability beyond the context of blockchain. In contrast, Solidity is designed specifically for Smart Contracts on the Ethereum platform.
